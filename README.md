This project is a modern weather application built with a Vue.js frontend and a Laravel backend.
It demonstrates best practices in both UI/UX design and code structure to ensure a maintainable, scalable, and user-friendly experience.

## ðŸŽ¨ UI & UX Design Principles

### âœ… Simplicity & Clarity
- The interface presents only essential elements, reducing visual clutter and helping users focus on finding weather info quickly.
- Weather details, city selection, and loading states are clearly separated using card components.

### âœ… Responsive Design
- The app layout adjusts seamlessly across devices using responsive CSS and flexible containers.
- Mobile-first design ensures usability on phones and tablets.

### âœ… User Feedback
- Loading states (spinners) are shown during API calls for a smoother experience.

## ðŸ§  Code Implementation Strategy

### âœ… Frontend (Vue 3 + Vite)
- **Component-based architecture** allows reusable and testable UI blocks like `WeatherCard`, `CitySelector`, etc.
- Uses `axios` with a centralized base URL and service abstraction to keep API logic clean.
- State and props are managed cleanly across components, and dynamic UI changes are reactive and predictable.

### âœ… Backend (Laravel 10)
- Follows Laravelâ€™s MVC structure, with clean separation of Controllers, Services, and Routes.
- Uses dependency injection and service classes (e.g. `WeatherService`) to keep controllers thin and testable.
- API routes are versioned and follow RESTful best practices.

### âœ… Testing
- Laravel tests use PHPUnit and Faker for data simulation.
- Service and controller logic is unit-tested for reliability and maintainability.
